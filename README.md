First Repository

Whassup u sucka ass playas, Lowgin's first repository in thisss bih. Gonna use it for my Python and Css files or something. I like skateboards and computers and pens and old books, and old tactical gear and the smores ritz bits. I'm not sure what I want to do in the future at all , I just know that in the end I wanna be slapping on a keyboard writing code for a 8 hours a day to make a living. I live in one of the most beautiful parts of Canada, Kelowna British Columbia, so moving away doesn't seem totally easy, but I'd like to move in the next year or so depending on how things go and try my hand at somewhere new and exciting. Hopefully I can start by doing small tasks for friends and such just to build up some meat for my resume (and just experience in general). Anyways my wireles keyboard is dying good luck with your programming Logan I believe in you G.
